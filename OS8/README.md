# Q1
sudo apt install git : install git
1- git config --global user.name "RezaMokaram"
2- git config --global user.email rezamokaramdost@gmail.com
you need to do this only once if you pass the --global option, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the --global option when youâ€™re in that project.
